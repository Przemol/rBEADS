Description: BEADS is a normalization scheme that corrects nucleotide
    composition bias, mappability variations and differential local DNA
    structural effects in deep sequencing data. In high-throughput sequencing
    data, the recovery of sequenced DNA fragments is not uniform along the
    genome. In particular, GC-rich sequences are often over-represented and
    AT-rich sequences under-represented in sequencing data. In addition, the
    read mapping procedure also generates regional bias. Sequence reads that
    can be mapped to multiple sites in the genome are usually discarded.
    Genomic regions with high degeneracy therefore show lower mapped read
    coverage than unique portions of the genome. Mappability varies along the
    genome and thus creates systematic bias. Futhermore, local DNA or chromatin
    structural effects can lead to coverage inhomogeneity of sequencing data.
