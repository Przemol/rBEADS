Description: BEADS is a normalization scheme that corrects nucleotide
    composition bias, mappability variations and differential local DNA
    structural effects in deep sequencing data. In high-throughput
    sequencing data, the recovery of sequenced DNA fragments is not
    uniform along the genome. In particular, GC-rich sequences are often
    over-represented and AT-rich sequences under-represented in sequencing
    data. In addition, the read mapping procedure also generates regional
    bias. Sequence reads that can be mapped to multiple sites in the
    genome are usually discarded.  Genomic regions with high degeneracy
    therefore show lower mapped read coverage than unique portions of the
    genome. Mappability varies along the genome and thus creates
    systematic bias. Futhermore, local DNA or chromatin structural effects
    can lead to coverage inhomogeneity of sequencing data.
